# SNAKEGAME
Snake game using python modules

GOALS
To practice python concepts.
To learn turtle, random and time modules in python.
To build a childhood dream game using simple code in hours.

TURTLE
Turtle is a pre-installed Python library that enables users to create pictures and shapes by providing them with a virtual canvas. The onscreen pen that you use for drawing is called the turtle and this is what gives the library its name.

RANDOM
Python Random module is an in-built module of Python that is used to generate random numbers in Python. These are pseudo-random numbers means they are not truly random. This module can be used to perform random actions such as generating random numbers, printing random a value for a list or string, etc.

TIME
In Python, the time() function returns the number of seconds passed since epoch (the point where time begins). For the Unix system, January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 at UTC is epoch. In the above example, we have used the time.time() function to get the current time in seconds since the epoch, and then printed the result.

THE END!!!!!!
